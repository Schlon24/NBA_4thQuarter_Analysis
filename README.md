# NBA 4th Quarter Analysis :Project Overview
*compares the first three quarters with the last quarter --> less points in the 4th quarter are a result of slower pace(less possesions), not because of more defensiv intensity
*scraped the games and boxscore stats of the 2019/2020 season (until the hiatus at the 11th March 2020, beacause of Covid-19)
*Engineered advanced stats from the traditional stats
*visualized different stats and trends in specific game situations
*made a 2 sample t-test to prove my observations
*KMeans clustering --> the top teams can elevate their game in the 4th quarter
